# Summary

PyMatLib is an extensible, open-source Python library that streamlines the definition and use of 
material properties in numerical simulations.
The library allows researchers to define complex material behaviors-ranging from simple constants to experimental data 
-in human-readable YAML configuration files.
These are automatically converted into symbolic mathematical expressions for direct use in scientific computing frameworks. 
PyMatLib supports both pure metals and alloys, 
offers six different property definition methods, 
and intelligently manages dependencies between different material properties.
It is designed for high-performance computing applications,
and serves as a seamless bridge between experimental data and numerical simulation,
making sophisticated material modeling accessible to a broader scientific community.

# Statement of Need

Accurate numerical simulation requires accounting for material properties—such as thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity
—that are not constant but depend on variables like temperature, pressure, or concentration [@lewis1996finite; @zienkiewicz2013finite]. 
This challenge is compounded by the wide variation in data availability, 
from well-characterized models for established materials to sparse experimental points for novel alloys. 
Consequently, property definitions can range from simple constants to complex tabular datasets or sophisticated equations, 
creating a significant integration hurdle for researchers.

To manage this complexity, researchers often resort to manual interpolation, custom scripting, or proprietary software, 
which compromises reproducibility and standardization [@ashby2013materials]. 
While valuable resources like the NIST WebBook [@nist_webbook] and libraries such as CoolProp [@coolprop] exist, 
they typically provide raw data without the integrated processing needed to unify these varied formats. 
Similarly, specialized CALPHAD databases [@calphad] are powerful but often require proprietary software 
and do not easily integrate with general-purpose simulation codes.

This gap forces the development of ad-hoc solutions, hindering workflow efficiency and the adoption of FAIR data principles [@wilkinson2016fair]. 
PyMatLib was created to bridge this gap by providing a unified, open-source framework that leverages 
symbolic mathematics, automatic regression, and dependency resolution to handle these disparate data sources. 
By combining a user-friendly YAML configuration with powerful backend processing, 
PyMatLib standardizes and simplifies the integration of realistic material behavior into scientific simulations.

# Key Functionality

- **Flexible Input Methods**: The library supports six different property definition methods: 
constant values, step functions, file-based data (Excel, CSV, txt), tabular data, piecewise equations, and computed properties (\autoref{fig:input_methods}). 
This versatility allows users to leverage data from diverse sources,
with robust file processing handled using pandas [@pandas].

![PyMatLib's property definition methods: (a) constant value, (b) step function, (c) file data, (d) tabular data, (e) piecewise equations, and (f) computed properties.\label{fig:input_methods}](figures/input_methods.png)

- **Universal Material Support**: The framework is designed with an extensible architecture to support any material type. 
It is currently implemented and thoroughly tested for pure metals and alloys through it's unified interface, 
with a modular design that allows for straightforward extension to other material classes such as 
ceramics, polymers, composites, or other specialized materials as research evolves. 

- **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: For properties that depend on others (e.g., thermal diffusivity calculated from thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity), 
PyMatLib automatically determines the correct processing order and resolves mathematical dependencies without manual intervention. 
The library detects circular dependencies and provides clear error messages for invalid configurations, 
freeing users from complex dependency management.

- **Regression and Data Reduction**: The library integrates pwlf [@pwlf] to perform piecewise regression for large datasets.
This simplifies complex property curves into efficient mathematical representations with configurable polynomial degrees and segments, 
reducing computational overhead while maintaining physical accuracy (\autoref{fig:regression_options_with_boundary_behavior}).

- **Configurable Boundary Behavior**: Users can define how properties behave outside their specified temperature ranges,
choosing between constant-value or linear extrapolation to best match the physical behavior of the material.
The boundary behavior options work seamlessly with the regression capabilities to provide comprehensive data processing control
(\autoref{fig:regression_options_with_boundary_behavior}).

![PyMatLib's data processing capabilities: regression and data reduction showing raw experimental data (points) fitted with different polynomial degrees and segment configurations, and boundary behavior options demonstrating constant versus extrapolate settings for the same density property, illustrating how PyMatLib can reduce complexity while maintaining physical accuracy and providing flexible boundary control.\label{fig:regression_options_with_boundary_behavior}](figures/regression_options_with_boundary_behavior.png)

- **Intelligent Simplification Timing**: PyMatLib provides sophisticated control over when data simplification occurs
in the dependency chain via the `simplify` parameter. 
`simplify: pre` simplifies properties before they are used in dependent calculations, optimizing performance.
With `simplify: post`, simplification is deferred until all dependent properties have been computed, maximizing numerical accuracy.
This timing control allows users to balance computational efficiency with numerical accuracy based on their specific simulation requirements.

```yaml
    bounds: [constant, extrapolate]  # Boundary behavior: 'constant' or 'extrapolate'
    regression:      # Optional regression configuration
      simplify: pre  # 'pre' (before processing) or 'post' (after processing)
      degree: 2      # Polynomial degree for regression
      segments: 3    # Number of piecewise segments
```

- **Bidirectional Property-Variable Inversion**: The library can automatically generate inverse piecewise functions, 
enabling the determination of independent variables from known property values (e.g., `temperature = f(property)`), 
a critical feature for energy-based numerical methods [@voller1987fixed], phase-change simulations, 
and iterative solvers where the independent variable must be determined from known property states. 
Currently, PyMatLib focuses on temperature-dependent properties, 
but the underlying architecture is designed to accommodate additional dependencies such as concentration, pressure, or shear rate in future versions. 
The inverse function generation supports linear piecewise segments 
(either through default linear interpolation or explicit `degree=1` regression), 
ensuring robust mathematical invertibility for the supported variable relationships.

- **Built-in Validation Framework**: A comprehensive validation framework checks YAML configurations for correctness,
including composition sums, required fields for pure metals versus alloys, and valid property names.
This prevents common configuration errors and ensures reproducible material definitions [@roache1998verification].

- **Integrated Visualization**: An integrated visualization tool using matplotlib [@matplotlib]
allows users to automatically generate plots to verify their property definitions visually,
with the option to disable visualization for production workflows after validation.

# Usage

A material is defined in a YAML file and loaded with a single function call.
The following examples demonstrate a pure metal and an alloy configuration, followed by the Python code to load and use the material.

## YAML Configuration Examples

### Pure Metal (`Al.yaml`)
```yaml
name: Aluminum
material_type: pure_metal

# Composition must sum to 1.0 (for pure metals, single element = 1.0)
composition:
  Al: 1.0  # Aluminum

# Required temperature properties for pure metals
melting_temperature: 933.47  # Solid becomes liquid (K)
boiling_temperature: 2743.0  # Liquid becomes gas (K)

properties:
  thermal_expansion_coefficient:
    temperature: [373.15, 473.15, 573.15, 673.15, 773.15, 873.15]
    value: [2.38e-05, 2.55e-05, 2.75e-05, 2.95e-05, 3.15e-05, 3.35e-05]

# Composition fractions must sum to 1.0
composition:
  Fe: 0.675  # Iron
  Cr: 0.170  # Chromium
  Ni: 0.120  # Nickel
  Mo: 0.025  # Molybdenum
  Mn: 0.010  # Manganese

# Required temperature properties for alloys
solidus_temperature: 1605.          # Melting begins (K)
liquidus_temperature: 1735.         # Material is completely melted (K)
initial_boiling_temperature: 3090.  # Boiling begins (K)

```
Complete YAML configurations are provided in the PyMatLib [documentation](https://github.com/rahildoshi97/pymatlib/blob/master/docs/how-to/define_materials.md). 

### Python Integration
The primary entry point is the create_material function, which parses the YAML file and returns a fully configured material object.
```python
    import sympy as sp
    from pymatlib.parsing.api import create_material

    # Create a material with a symbolic temperature variable
    T = sp.Symbol('T')
    aluminum = create_material('Al.yaml', T, enable_plotting=True)

    # Access properties as symbolic expressions
    print(f"Density: {aluminum.density}")
    # Output: Piecewise((2678.43051234161, u_C < 300.0), 
    #                   (2744.36352618972 - 0.21977671282703*u_C, u_C < 3000.0), 
    #                   (2085.03338770863, True))

    # Evaluate properties at a specific temperature
    density_at_500K = aluminum.density.subs(T, 500).evalf()
    print(f"Density at 500 K: {density_at_500K:.2f} kg/m^3")
    # Output: Density at 500 K: 2634.48 kg/m^3
```
